**Mexicesta** is a mobile app designed to help you organize your shopping effortlessly. Perfect for when you're offline, Mexicesta allows you to create and manage shopping carts with an unlimited number of items.

## Why Does Mexicesta Exist?

Every Saturday, I used to jot down all the items I planned to buy at the tianguis. To streamline this process and keep all my shopping needs organized, I decided to create Mexicesta. This app allows me to keep track of everything I need to purchase in one convenient place, making my shopping trips more efficient and hassle-free.

## Architecture & More

This project combines **Screaming Architecture** with a **Feature-Based Architecture** approach. Files and folders are organized based on their functionality and usage, making the system's structure intuitive and easy to navigate.

- **Screaming Architecture**: This approach ensures that the system's core logic and business rules are clearly defined and easily understood.
- **Feature-Based Architecture**: This method organizes the codebase by features rather than technical layers, making it easier to manage and scale.

In addition, to simplify imports and avoid cumbersome relative paths (`../.../`), **alias paths** have been set up. This allows for cleaner and more maintainable code by referencing modules with simpler, more descriptive paths.

### Reusable Components & Global Settings
In Mexicesta, the design and architecture are optimized for reusability and consistency. Every component and setting in the app is designed to be declared once and reused wherever necessary. This approach ensures a cohesive look and feel throughout the application while minimizing redundancy.

## Dependencies

This project uses several libraries and tools to enhance functionality and development. Below is a list of the main dependencies and their purposes:

### **Frontend Dependencies**

- **Zustand**: A package to manage the global state of the App, providing a simple and scalable way to handle state management.
- **Linear Gradient**: A package used to create beautiful gradient backgrounds. This package was used to design the app's background, adding a stylish gradient transition from one color to another.
